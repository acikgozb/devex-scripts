# acikgozb-rofi

This repository holds several helper scripts that uses `rofi-wayland` to have some kind of DE (Desktop Environment) functionality, such as:

- Power control (shutdown, logout, hibernate),
- Bluetooth (connect/disconnect devices),
- Wifi

The intended usage is to add the scripts under `$PATH` and then execute them either through `hyprland` or `waybar`.

The scripts are in progress, this README will be updated once the initial version is ready to publish.
